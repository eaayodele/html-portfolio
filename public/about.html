  <h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello! I'm a graduate with a Bachelor of Medical Laboratory Science, 
passionate about mental health and rehabilitation. <br /> My journey has been driven
by a deep commitment to helping others, especially those struggling with 
 addiction and seeking therapy.</p>

 <p>
  With experience in supporting friends through their recovery journeys, 
  I've developed a keen interest in writing health content, particularly<br /> 
  related to mental health. I'm currently working towards becoming a registered
   counselor and exploring scholarships for aspiring counselors and 
   clinical psychologists.
 </p>

 <p>
  In addition to my professional pursuits, I'm learning to code and create 
  web pages, aiming to blend my technical skills with my passion for mental 
  health advocacy. <br /> When I'm not immersed in my studies or coding projects, I 
  enjoy spending quality time with my girlfriend, 
  often sending her romantic messages to brighten her day.
 </p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my page, and I look forward to connecting with you.</p>
